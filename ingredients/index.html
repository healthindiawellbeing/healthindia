incredible how the process of making wheat into Dalia or Broken Wheat originated about 4000 years ago. It is believed to have originated in the Mediterranean region and soon became an integral part of the Eastern cuisine. In 2800 B.C, it was declared to be one of the sacred crops.</p><h4>1.

Diet is vital to a weight loss routine and broken wheat is instrumental to weight management.</p><h4>2. In asthma management:</h4><p align="justify">Asthma is a common problem these days. Alongside adults, even children are facing severe breathing issue due to asthma. Broken wheat is extremely beneficial in reducing the risk of Asthma. It is rich in Vitamin C and Vitamin E which reduces the narrowing of airways and protects the respiratory system. It is also ideal for bronchitis.</p><h4>3. In diabetic management:</h4><p align="justify">Broken wheat is a power packed cereal which has most essential vitamins and minerals. It also has a very low glycemic index. Moreover, it is extremely low in fats and carbohydrates which make it an ideal food for people suffering from diabetes especially, Type-2 diabetes.</p><h4>4. In cancer prevention:</h4><p align="justify">Broken wheat is known to prevent cancer. It has a high content of insoluble fiber which is known to reduce the risk of cancer. It is extremely beneficial for women as it reduces the occurrence of breast cancer. It also prevents lump formation in the body. Eating broken wheat regularly reduces the risk of cancer by almost 80%. It is recommended to have 2 cups of broken wheat daily for women to prevent breast cancer after menopause.</p><div class="title"><h1>Brown Rice</h1></div><p align="justify">Brown rice is an unrefined, unpolished whole grain produced by removing the surrounding hull of the rice kernel. The grain retains its nutrient-dense bran and germ layer. It is chewier as compared with white rice and has a nutty flavor. According to the USDA FoodData Central, it is rich in essential minerals such as manganese, iron, zinc, phosphorus, calcium, selenium, magnesium, and potassium. Its vitamin wealth may include B-vitamins – vitamin B1, B2, B3, B6, vitamin E and vitamin K. It is a source of protein and contains a good amount of fiber. Along with this, it is also a provider of fatty acids.</p><h4>1. In diabetic management:</h4><p align="justify">Brown rice may be beneficial for diabetics and hyperglycemic individuals. It has a low glycemic index, which would help reduce insulin surges and assist in the stabilization of blood sugar levels in the body. A comparative study published in the International Journal of Food Sciences and Nutrition revealed that it may be rich in phytic acid, fiber, and essential polyphenols. It is a complex carbohydrate that can help in the slower release of sugar as compared to white rice.</p><h4>2. In weight management:</h4><p align="justify">Brown rice is one food proven to be instrumental in weight control for many people combating obesity. A study conducted in this regard revealed that whole grains such as brown rice, may have positive effects on the body concerning a reduction in body mass index and fat. They might also enhance the activity of glutathione peroxidase, an antioxidant enzyme linked with elevating the levels of HDL (good) cholesterol in obese individuals. Another comparative animal research study also suggests the anti-obesity effects of the germinated variety.</p><h4>3. In boosting heart health:</h4><p align="justify">The benefits of whole grains over processed food for heart health are known to many. Germinated brown rice could be a potential source of magnesium and proanthocyanidin, which may help reduce cardiovascular complications and also decrease the risk of heart attack and stroke. A Nurses’ Health Study published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition also suggests that overall increased intake of whole grains may have a protective effect against coronary heart diseases.</p><h4>4. In cholesterol level management:</h4><p align="justify">Brown rice is found to have minimal cholesterol content and might work well as a replacement for any cholesterol-rich options in your diet. An investigative study performed on rats revealed that it may possess hypocholesterolemic qualities, thus regulating cholesterol catabolism. It may also contain beneficial nutrients that help in lipid and glucose metabolism. More research is needed, but initial findings are promising regarding the role played by brown rice in lowering cholesterol.</p><h4>5. In maintaing bone health:</h4><p align="justify">Brown rice may prove to be helpful for the maintenance of healthy bones, as it is rich in magnesium which, along with calcium, provides the bones their physical structure. Magnesium-rich, it may help mitigate bone demineralization and is beneficial for medical conditions such as arthritis and osteoporosis.</p><div class="title"><h1>Ragi - The wonder grain</h1></div><p align="justify">Ragi is a super grain that has recently made a comeback. It is a hardy crop that can grow in high altitudes and withstand harsh weather conditions, making it perfectly suited for the Indian climatic conditions. It is popularly known as Finger Millet/Nachni in North India.</p><h4>1. In diabetic management:</h4><p align="justify">The grain's seed coat is abundant in polyphenols and dietary fibres as compared to rice, maize or wheat. The low glycemic index lessens food cravings and maintains the digestive pace, consequently, keeping blood sugar within the safe range. "It is best to add it to your morning meal or have it for lunch in order to keep your system on track the whole day," says Dr.Sood.</p><h4>2. In maintaing skin health:</h4><p align="justify">Ragi works wonders for maintaining young and youthful skin. Vital amino acids like Methionine and Lysine present in it make the skin tissues less prone to wrinkles and sagging. Dr. Sood explains, "Ragi is also one of the very few natural sources of Vitamin D which is mostly derived from sunlight. Vitamin D is a carrier molecule for calcium, which accounts for vitality."</p><h4>3. In weight management:</h4><p align="justify">The high amount of dietary fibre keeps the stomach full for a longer and prevents unwanted cravings. This in turn leads to a minimised appetite and weight loss. "Ragi flour lowers your blood sugar levels in the body by activating insulin." says Dr. Sood.</p><h4>4. In relaxing the body and mind:</h4><p align="justify">Regular consumption of Ragi is highly beneficial in dealing with conditions of anxiety, depression and insomnia.The presence of antioxidants, mainly Tryptophan and amino acids, helps as they work as natural relaxants. As per a study conducted by MedIndia Ragi consumption is also useful in dealing with migraines.</p><h4>5. In battling anemia:</h4><p align="justify">Ragi is an excellent source of natural iron and thus a boon for anemic patients and also for those with low haemoglobin levels. Once ragi is allowed to sprout, the Vitamin C levels tend to increase and lead to easy absorption of iron into the bloodstream. Dr. Sood tells us, "For the optimum absorption of iron, you can consume it in the form of Ragi Dosa or Ragi Balls, with plenty of vegetables and a generous squeeze of lime or a bowl of Sambar.</p><div class="title"><h1>Millets</h1></div><p align="justify">Millets are rich in niacin, which helps your body manage more than 400 enzyme reactions. Niacin is also important for healthy skin and organ function. In fact, it’s such an important compound that it’s often added to processed foods to enrich them. Millets, especially the darker varieties, are also an excellent source of beta-carotene. This natural pigment acts as both an antioxidant and as a precursor to vitamin A, helping your body fight off free radicals and supporting the health of your eyes.</p><h4>1. In controlling blood sugar:</h4><p align="justify">Millets are low in simple carbohydrates and higher in complex carbohydrates, making them a low-glycemic index (GI) food. This means millets take longer to digest than standard wheat flour. Low-GI foods can help keep your blood sugar from spiking after eating, which allows people with diabetes to manage their blood sugar levels more easily.</p><h4>2. In improving digestive health:</h4><p align="justify">Millets are rich in dietary fiber, both soluble and insoluble. The insoluble fiber in millets is known as a “prebiotic,” which means it supports good bacteria in your digestive system. This type of fiber is also important for adding bulk to stools, which helps keep you regular and reduces your risk of colon cancer.</p><h4>3. In providing nutrition:</h4><p align="justify">Millets are rich in potassium—a mineral that supports healthy kidney and heart function. Potassium also plays a role in nerve signal transmission, which is how your brain and muscles communicate. It’s also an excellent source of: Vitamin A, B, Calcium, Iron etc.</p><h4>4. In weight management:</h4><p align="justify">Millets are a boon for all those who want to attain optimal weight. Including millets in the regular regimen can remarkably help in lowering the BMI of obese people. Swapping rice with millets daily can lower accumulation of fat, improves gut health and help you in achieving sustained weight loss.</p><div class="title"><h1>Bajra</h1></div><h4>1. In improving heart health:</h4><p align="justify">Bajra is rich in magnesium, which helps keep the heart healthy. It has potassium, which dilates blood vessels, allowing blood to flow more easily. This helps reduce overall blood pressure. Bajra also has fibre that helps reduce LDL, or bad cholesterol. Magnesium helps control the glucose receptors in the body and keep diabetes at bay.</p><h4>2. In detoxing:</h4><p align="justify">Bajra contains phytic acid, tannins and phenols, all antioxidants which help in preventing ageing and metabolic diseases like heart disease, stroke and cancer. It also contains catechins like quercetin that help keep the kidney and liver functioning properly by excreting the toxins from the body.</p><h4>3. High in fibre:</h4><p align="justify">Digestion is sluggish during the rainy season, so it helps to stick to high-fibre foods like bajra. It is loaded with insoluble fibre that provides bulk to the stool and keeps away constipation.</p><div class="title"><h1>Sorghum (Jowar)</h1></div><p align="justify">Jowar is globally known as the “new quinoa” for its gluten-free and whole-grain goodness. In India, jowar is a staple food item. It has many words in different states, namely, Cholam in Tamil Nadu and Jonna in Andhra Pradesh. Since it is a member of the millet family, jowar is gaining massive attention these days. It contains B vitamins, which help the body build new tissues and cells and potassium and phosphorus. Additionally, Jowar contains traces of zinc, copper, and over 20 micronutrients and high levels of antioxidants.</p><h4>1. In controlling blood sugar:</h4><p align="justify">Jowar is a complex carbohydrate that digests slowly. As a result, it leads to stable blood sugar levels. Hence, it is a great diet choice for diabetics and people who want to lose weight.</p><h4>2. In maintaining bone health:</h4><p align="justify">Because it contains high magnesium levels, jowar helps maintain calcium levels in the body (magnesium increases calcium absorption).</p><h4>3. In weight management:</h4><p align="justify">Jowar has a much higher concentration of dietary fibre when compared to other cereal grains. This high fibre content ensures higher satiety levels, lowering consumption by keeping hunger pangs at bay.</p><h4>4. In improving the digestive system:</h4><p align="justify">The high dietary fibre content in Jowar also helps improve digestion. The fibre is a bulking agent that helps stool pass smoothly through the digestive tract. The whole grain helps improve digestive health and helps to treat conditions like diarrhoea, bloating, stomach ache and constipation.</p></div></article></div></div></div><script src="https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js" async></script><script>!function(e){function t(t){for(var n,o,i=t[0],c=t[1],f=t[2],l=0,d=[];l<i.length;l++)o=i[l],Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(a,o)&&a[o]&&d.push(a[o][0]),a[o]=0;for(n in c)Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(c,n)&&(e[n]=c[n]);for(s&&s(t);d.length;)d.shift()();return u.push.apply(u,f||[]),r()}function r(){for(var e,t=0;t<u.length;t++){for(var r=u[t],n=!0,o=1;o<r.length;o++){var c=r[o];0!==a[c]&&(n=!1)}n&&(u.splice(t--,1),e=i(i.s=r[0]))}return e}var n={},o={1:0},a={1:0},u=[];function i(t){if(n[t])return n[t].exports;var r=n[t]={i:t,l:!1,exports:{}};return e[t].call(r.exports,r,r.exports,i),r.l=!0,r.exports}i.e=function(e){var t=[];o[e]?t.push(o[e]):0!==o[e]&&{3:1}[e]&&t.push(o[e]=new Promise((function(t,r){for(var n="static/css/"+({}[e]||e)+"."+{3:"1df93df0",4:"31d6cfe0",5:"31d6cfe0",6:"31d6cfe0",7:"31d6cfe0",8:"31d6cfe0",9:"31d6cfe0",10:"31d6cfe0"}[e]+".chunk.css",a=i.p+n,u=document.getElementsByTagName("link"),c=0;c<u.length;c++){var f=(s=u[c]).getAttribute("data-href")||s.getAttribute("href");if("stylesheet"===s.rel&&(f===n||f===a))return t()}var l=document.getElementsByTagName("style");for(c=0;c<l.length;c++){var s;if((f=(s=l[c]).getAttribute("data-href"))===n||f===a)return t()}var d=document.createElement("link");d.rel="stylesheet",d.type="text/css",d.onload=t,d.onerror=function(t){var n=t&&t.target&&t.target.src||a,u=new Error("Loading CSS chunk "+e+" failed.\n("+n+")");u.code="CSS_CHUNK_LOAD_FAILED",u.request=n,delete o[e],d.parentNode.removeChild(d),r(u)},d.href=a,document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(d)})).then((function(){o[e]=0})));var r=a[e];if(0!==r)if(r)t.push(r[2]);else{var n=new Promise((function(t,n){r=a[e]=[t,n]}));t.push(r[2]=n);var u,c=document.createElement("script");c.charset="utf-8",c.timeout=120,i.nc&&c.setAttribute("nonce",i.nc),c.src=function(e){return i.p+"static/js/"+({}[e]||e)+"."+{3:"a546e516",4:"c2361287",5:"b3027f13",6:"329fffb6",7:"d14d0e8a",8:"735a651a",9:"04a115eb",10:"05156739"}[e]+".chunk.js"}(e);var f=new Error;u=function(t){c.onerror=c.onload=null,clearTimeout(l);var r=a[e];if(0!==r){if(r){var n=t&&("load"===t.type?"missing":t.type),o=t&&t.target&&t.target.src;f.message="Loading chunk "+e+" failed.\n("+n+": "+o+")",f.name="ChunkLoadError",f.type=n,f.request=o,r[1](f)}a[e]=void 0}};var l=setTimeout((function(){u({type:"timeout",target:c})}),12e4);c.onerror=c.onload=u,document.head.appendChild(c)}return Promise.all(t)},i.m=e,i.c=n,i.d=function(e,t,r){i.o(e,t)||Object.defineProperty(e,t,{enumerable:!0,get:r})},i.r=function(e){"undefined"!=typeof Symbol&&Symbol.toStringTag&&Object.defineProperty(e,Symbol.toStringTag,{value:"Module"}),Object.defineProperty(e,"__esModule",{value:!0})},i.t=function(e,t){if(1&t&&(e=i(e)),8&t)return e;if(4&t&&"object"==typeof e&&e&&e.__esModule)return e;var r=Object.create(null);if(i.r(r),Object.defineProperty(r,"default",{enumerable:!0,value:e}),2&t&&"string"!=typeof e)for(var n in e)i.d(r,n,function(t){return e[t]}.bind(null,n));return r},i.n=function(e){var t=e&&e.__esModule?function(){return e.default}:function(){return e};return i.d(t,"a",t),t},i.o=function(e,t){return Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(e,t)},i.p="/healthindia/",i.oe=function(e){throw console.error(e),e};var c=this["webpackJsonppersonal-site"]=this["webpackJsonppersonal-site"]||[],f=c.push.bind(c);c.push=t,c=c.slice();for(var l=0;l<c.length;l++)t(c[l]);var s=f;r()}([])</script><script src="/healthindia/static/js/2.78c46b0b.chunk.js"></script><script src="/healthindia/static/js/main.af2f5bf3.chunk.js"></script></body></html>
