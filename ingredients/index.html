Once ragi is allowed to sprout, the Vitamin C levels tend to increase and lead to easy absorption of iron into the bloodstream. Dr. Sood tells us, "For the optimum absorption of iron, you can consume it in the form of Ragi Dosa or Ragi Balls, with plenty of vegetables and a generous squeeze of lime or a bowl of Sambar.</p><div class="title"><h1>Fenugreek (Methi)</h1></div><h4>1.
