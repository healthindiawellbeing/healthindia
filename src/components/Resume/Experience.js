      The grain&#39;s seed coat is abundant in polyphenols and dietary fibres as compared to rice,
      maize or wheat. The low glycemic index lessens food cravings and maintains the digestive pace,
      consequently, keeping blood sugar within the safe range. &quot;It is best to add it to your
      morning meal or have it for lunch in order to keep your system on track the whole day,&quot;
      says Dr.Sood.

      Methionine and Lysine present in it make the skin tissues less prone to wrinkles and sagging.
      Dr. Sood explains, &quot;Ragi is also one of the very few natural sources of Vitamin D which
      is mostly derived from sunlight. Vitamin D is a carrier molecule for calcium, which accounts
      for vitality.&quot;
    </p>

      Ragi is an excellent source of natural iron and thus a boon for anemic patients and also for
      those with low haemoglobin levels. Once ragi is allowed to sprout, the Vitamin C levels tend
      to increase and lead to easy absorption of iron into the bloodstream. Dr. Sood tells us,
      &quot;For the optimum absorption of iron, you can consume it in the form of Ragi Dosa or
      Ragi Balls, with plenty of vegetables and a generous squeeze of lime or a bowl of Sambar.
