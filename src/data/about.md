# What is Health

World Health Organization (WHO), defined Health as being “a state of complete physical,
mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity”.
A stressful lifestyle, faulty food habits, frequent use of medications and even common
persons need an advanced nutrition to meet their daily nutritional requirements.
